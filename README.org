#+TITLE: Behlerâ€“Parrinello potential for ASE
*This project is still under development. There's nothing usable here yet.*

This project is inspired by [[https://bitbucket.org/andrewpeterson/amp][Amp]].
The plan is to build everything on tensorflow and ASE, so that I can worry less about lower-level optimizations.

* Things to implement
- [ ] BPNN potential
- [ ] BPNN potential with electrostatic interactions
- [ ] Trainable symmetry function paramters
- [ ] Queuing support
- [ ] Visualization of models
